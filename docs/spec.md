# IN3-Protocol

This document describes the communication between a Incubed client and a Incubed node. This communication is based on requests that use extended [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)-Format. Especially for ethereum-based requests, this means each node also accepts all standard requests as defined at [Ethereum JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), which also includes handling Bulk-requests. 

Each request may add an optional `in3` property defining the verification behavior for Incubed.


## Incubed Requests

Requests without an `in3` property will also get a response without `in3`. This allows any Incubed node to also act as a raw ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint. The `in3` property in the request is defined as the following:  

*  **chainId** `string<hex>` - The requested [chainId](#chainid). This property is optional, but should always be specified in case a node may support multiple chains. In this case, the default of the node would be used, which may end up in an undefined behavior since the client cannot know the default. 

*  **includeCode** `boolean` - Applies only for `eth_call`-requests. If true, the request should include the codes of all accounts. Otherwise only the the codeHash is returned. In this case, the client may ask by calling `eth_getCode()` afterwards.   

*  **verifiedHashes** `string<bytes32>[]` - If the client sends an array of blockhashes, the server will not deliver any signatures or blockheaders for these blocks, but only return a string with a number. This allows the client to skip requiring signed blockhashes for blocks already verified.

*  **latestBlock** `integer` - If specified, the blocknumber `latest` will be replaced by a blockNumber-specified value. This allows the Incubed client to define finality for PoW-Chains, which is important, since the `latest`-block cannot be considered final and therefore it would be unlikely to find nodes willing to sign a blockhash for such a block.    

*  **useRef** `boolean` - If true, binary-data (starting with a 0x) will be referred if occurring again. This decreases the payload especially for recurring data such as merkle proofs. If supported, the server (and client) will keep track of each binary value storing them in a temporary array. If the previously used value is used again, the server replaces it with `:<index>`. The client then resolves such refs by lookups in the temporary array.   

*  **useBinary** `boolean` - If true, binary-data will be used. This format is optimzed for embedded devices and reduces the payload to about 30%. For details see [the Binary-spec](#binary-format).

*  **useFullProof** `boolean` - If true, all data in the response will be proven, which leads to a higher payload. The result depends on the method called and will be specified there.

*  **finality** `number` - For PoA-Chains, it will deliver additional proof to reach finality.  If given, the server will deliver the blockheaders of the following blocks until at least the number in percent of the validators is reached.   

*  **verification** `string` - Defines the kind of proof the client is asking for. Must be one of the these values: 
    - `'never`' : No proof will be delivered (default). Also no `in3`-property will be added to the response, but only the raw JSON-RPC response will be returned. 
    - `'proof`' : The proof will be created including a blockheader, but without any signed blockhashes.
    - `'proofWithSignature`' : The returned proof will also include signed blockhashes as required in `signatures`.

*  **signatures** `string<address>[]` - A list of addresses (as 20bytes in hex) requested to sign the blockhash.    

A example of an Incubed request may look like this:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "eth_getTransactionByHash",
    "params": ["0xf84cfb78971ebd940d7e4375b077244e93db2c3f88443bb93c561812cfed055c"],
    "in3": {
        "chainId": "0x1",
        "verification": "proofWithSignature",
        "signatures":["0x784bfa9eb182C3a02DbeB5285e3dBa92d717E07a"]
  }
}
```


## Incubed Responses

Each Incubed node response is based on JSON-RPC, but also adds the `in3` property. If the request does not contain a `in3` property or does not require proof, the response must also omit the `in3` property.

If the proof is requested, the `in3` property is defined with the following properties:

*  **proof** [Proof](#proofs) - The Proof-data, which depends on the requested method. For more details, see the [Proofs](#proofs) section.

*  **lastNodeList** `number` - The blocknumber for the last block updating the nodelist. This blocknumber should be used to indicate changes in the nodelist. If the client has a smaller blocknumber, it should update the nodeList.  

*  **lastValidatorChange** `number` - The blocknumber of the last change of the validatorList (only for PoA-chains). If the client has a smaller number, it needs to update the validatorlist first. For details, see [PoA Validations](#poa-validations)   

*  **currentBlock** `number` - The current blocknumber. This number may be stored in the client in order to run sanity checks for `latest` blocks or `eth_blockNumber`, since they cannot be verified directly.   

An example of such a response would look like this:

## ChainId

Incubed supports multiple chains and a client may even run requests to different chains in parallel. While, in most cases, a chain refers to a specific running blockchain, chainIds may also refer to abstract networks such as ipfs. So, the definition of a chain in the context of Incubed is simply a distributed data domain offering verifiable api-functions implemented in an in3-node.

Each chain is identified by a `uint64` identifier written as hex-value (without leading zeros). Since incubed started with ethereum, the chainIds for public ethereum-chains are based on the intrinsic chainId of the ethereum-chain. See https://chainid.network.

For each chain, Incubed manages a list of nodes as stored in the [server registry](#registry) and a chainspec describing the verification. These chainspecs are held in the client, as they specify the rules about how responses may be validated.

## Registry

As Incubed aims for fully decentralized access to the blockchain, the registry is implemented as an ethereum smart contract. 

This contract serves different purposes. Primarily, it manages all the Incubed nodes, both the onboarding and also unregistering process. In order to do so, it must also manage the deposits: reverting when the amount of provided ether is smaller than the current minimum deposit; but also locking and/or sending back deposits after a server leaves the in3-network.

In addition, the contract is also used to secure the in3-network by providing functions to "convict" servers that provided a wrongly signed block, and also having a function to vote out inactive servers.

### Node structure

Each Incubed node must be registered in the ServerRegistry in order to be known to the network. A node or server is defined as: 

*  **url** `string` - The public url of the node, which must accept JSON-RPC requests.

*  **owner** `address` - The owner of the node with the permission to edit or remove the node.  

*  **signer** `address` - The address used when signing blockhashes. This address must be unique within the nodeList.   

*  **timeout** `uint64` - Timeout after which the owner is allowed to receive its stored deposit. This information is also important for the client, since an invalid blockhash-signature can only "convict" as long as the server is registered. A long timeout may provide higher security since the node can not lie and unregister right away.

*  **deposit** `uint256` - The deposit stored for the node, which the node will lose if it signs a wrong blockhash.

*  **props** `uint64` - A bitmask defining the capabilities of the node:

    - `0x01` : **proof** :  The node is able to deliver proof. If not set, it may only serve pure ethereum JSON/RPC. Thus, simple remote nodes may also be registered as Incubed nodes.
    - `0x02` : **multichain** : The same RPC endpoint may also accept requests for different chains.
    - `0x04` : **archive** : If set, the node is able to support archive requests returning older states. If not, only a pruned node is running.
    - `0x08` : **http** : If set, the node will also serve requests on standard http even if the url specifies https. This is relevant for small embedded devices trying to save resources by not having to run the TLS.
    - `0x10` : **binary** : If set, the node accepts request with `binary:true`. This reduces the payload to about 30% for embedded devices.

    More properties will be added in future versions.

*  **unregisterTime** `uint64` - The earliest timestamp when the node can unregister itself by calling `confirmUnregisteringServer`.  This will only be set after the node requests an unregister. The client nodes with an `unregisterTime` set have less trust, since they will not be able to convict after this timestamp.

*  **registerTime** `uint64` - The timestamp, when the server was registered.

*  **weight** `uint64` - The number of parallel requests this node may accept. A higher number indicates a stronger node, which will be used within the incentivization layer to calculate the score.

The following functions are offered within the registry:

//TODO add interface for new contract.

### BlockHashRegistry Functions

## Binary Format

Since Incubed is optimized for embedded devices, a server can not only support JSON, but a special binary-format. 
You may wonder why we don't want to use any existing binary serialization for JSON like CBOR or others. The reason is simply: because we do not need to support all the features JSON offers. The following features are not supported:
- no escape sequences (this allows use of the string without copying it)
- no float support (at least for now)
- no string literals starting with `0x` since this is always considered as hexcoded bytes
- no propertyNames within the same object with the same key hash

Since we are able to accept these restrictions, we can keep the JSON-parser simple.
This binary-format is highly optimized for small devices and will reduce the payload to about 30%. This is achieved with the following optimizations:

* All strings starting with `0x`are interpreted as binary data and stored as such, which reduces the size of the data to 50%.
* Recurring byte-values will use references to previous data, which reduces the payload, especially for merkle proofs.
* All propertyNames of JSON-objects are hashed to a 16bit-value, reducing the size of the data to a signifivant amount (depending on the propertyName).

  The hash is calculated very easily like this:
  ```c
  static d_key_t key(const char* c) {
    uint16_t val = 0, l = strlen(c);
    for (; l; l--, c++) val ^= *c | val << 7;
    return val;
  }
  ````


```eval_rst
.. note:: A very important limitation is the fact that property names are stored as 16bit hashes, which decreases the payload, but does not allow for the restoration of the full json without knowing all property names! 
```

The binary format is based on JSON-structure, but uses a RLP-encoding approach. Each node or value is represented by these four values:

*  **key** `uint16_t` - The key hash of the property. This value will only pass before the property node if the structure is a property of a JSON-object. 
*  **type** `d_type_t` - 3 bit : defining the type of the element.
*  **len** `uint32_t` - 5 bit : the length of the data (for bytes/string/array/object). For (boolean or integer) the length will specify the value. 
*  **data** `bytes_t` - The bytes or value of the node (only for strings or bytes).


```eval_rst
.. graphviz::

    digraph g{
      rankdir=LR;

      node[fontname="Helvetica",   shape=record, color=lightblue ]
      propHash[label="key|16 bit", style=dashed]
      type[label="type|{type (3bit) | len (5bit)}"]
      len2[label="len ext",  style=dashed]
      data[label="data",  style=dashed]
      propHash -> type -> len2 -> data
    }


```


The serialization depends on the type, which is defined in the first 3 bits of the first byte of the element:

```c
d_type_t type = *val >> 5;     // first 3 bits define the type
uint8_t  len  = *val & 0x1F;   // the other 5 bits  (0-31) the length
```

The `len` depends on the size of the data. So, the last 5 bit of the first bytes are interpreted as follows:

* `0x00` - `0x1c` : The length is taken as is from the 5 bits.
* `0x1d` - `0x1f` : The length is taken by reading the big-endian value of the next `len - 0x1c` bytes (len ext).  

After the type-byte and optional length bytes, the 2 bytes representing the property hash is added, but only if the element is a property of a JSON-object.    

Depending on these types, the length will be used to read the next bytes:

* `0x0` : **binary data** - This would be a value or property with binary data. The `len` will be used to read the number of bytes as binary data.
* `0x1` : **string data** - This would be a value or property with string data. The `len` will be used to read the number of bytes (+1) as string. The string will always be null-terminated, since it will allow small devices to use the data directly instead of copying memory in RAM.
* `0x2` : **array** - Represents an array node, where the `len` represents the number of elements in the array. The array elements will be added right after the array-node.
* `0x3` : **object** - A JSON-object with `len` properties coming next. In this case the properties following this element will have a leading `key` specified.
* `0x4` : **boolean** - Boolean value where `len` must be either `0x1`= `true` or `0x0` = `false`. If `len > 1` this element is a copy of a previous node and may reference the same data. The index of the source node will then be `len-2`.
* `0x5` : **integer** - An integer-value with max 29 bit (since the 3 bits are used for the type). If the value is higher than `0x20000000`, it will be stored as binary data.
* `0x6` : **null** - Represents a null-value. If this value has a `len`> 0 it will indicate the beginning of data, where `len` will be used to specify the number of elements to follow. This is optional, but helps small devices to allocate the right amount of memory.


## Communication

Incubed requests follow a simple request/response schema allowing even devices with a small bandwith to retrieve all the required data with one request. But there are exceptions when additional data need to be fetched.

These are:

1. **Changes in the NodeRegistry**    

    Changes in the NodeRegistry are based on one of the following events: 
    
    - `LogNodeRegistered`
    - `LogNodeRemoved`
    - `LogNodeChanged`

    The server needs to watch for events from the `NodeRegistry` contract, and update the nodeList when needed.
    
    Changes are detected by the client by comparing the blocknumber of the latest change with the last known blocknumber. Since each response will include the `lastNodeList`, a client may detect this change after receiving the data. The client is then expected to call `in3_nodeList` to update its nodeList before sending out the next request. In the event that the node is not able to proof the new nodeList, the client may blacklist such a node.

  ```eval_rst
    .. uml::

      Client -> NodeA: Request
      NodeA --> Client: Response with lastNodeList

      Client --> Client: check if lastNodeList increased

      Client -> NodeB: Request in3_nodeList
      NodeB --> Client: verify and update nodeList and lastNodeList


  ```


2. **Changes in the ValidatorList**    

    This only applies to PoA-chains where the client needs a defined and verified validatorList. Depending on the consensus, changes in the validatorList must be detected by the node and indicated with the `lastValidatorChange` on each response. This `lastValidatorChange` holds the last blocknumber of a change in the validatorList.  
    
    Changes are detected by the client by comparing the blocknumber of the latest change with the last known blocknumber. Since each response will include the `lastValidatorChange` a client may detect this change after receiving the data or in case of an unverifiable response. The client is then expected to call `in3_validatorList` to update its list before sending out the next request. In the event that the node is not able to proof the new nodeList, the client may blacklist such a node.

3. **Failover**    

    It is also good to have a second request in the event that a valid response is not delivered. This could happen if a node does not respond at all or the response cannot be validated. In both cases, the client may blacklist the node for a while and send the same request to another node.


## Proofs

Proofs are a crucial part of the security concept for Incubed. Whenever a request is made for a response with `verification`: `proof`, the node must provide the proof needed to validate the response result. The proof itself depends on the chain.

### Ethereum

For ethereum, all proofs are based on the correct block hash. That's why verification differentiates between [Verifying the blockhash](poa.html) (which depends on the user consensus) the actual result data.

There is another reason why the BlockHash is so important. This is the only value you are able to access from within a SmartContract, because the evm supports a OpCode (`BLOCKHASH`), which allows you to read the last 256 blockhashes, which gives us the chance to verify even the blockhash onchain.

Depending on the method, different proofs are needed, which are described in this document.

- **[Block Proof](#blockproof)** - Verifies the content of the BlockHeader.
- **[Transaction Proof](#transaction-proof)** - Verifies the input data of a transaction.
- **[Receipt Proof](#receipt-proof)** - Verifies the outcome of a transaction.
- **[Log Proof](#log-proof)** - Verifies the response of `eth_getPastLogs`.
- **[Account Proof](#account-proof)** - Verifies the state of an account.
- **[Call Proof](#call-proof)** - Verifies the result of an `eth_call`-response.

Each `in3`-section of the response containing proofs has a property with a proof-object with the following properties:

*  **type** `string` (required)  - The type of the proof.   
 Must be one of the these values : `'transactionProof`', `'receiptProof`', `'blockProof`', `'accountProof`', `'callProof`', `'logProof`'
*  **block** `string` - The serialized blockheader as hex, required in most proofs. 
*  **finalityBlocks** `array` - The serialized following blockheaders as hex, required in case of finality asked (only relevant for PoA-chains). The server must deliver enough blockheaders to cover more then 50% of the validators. In order to verify them, they must be linkable (with the parentHash).    
*  **transactions** `array` - The list of raw transactions of the block if needed to create a merkle trie for the transactions. 
*  **uncles** `array` - The list of uncle-headers of the block. This will only be set if full verification is required in order to create a merkle tree for the uncles and so prove the uncle_hash.   
*  **merkleProof** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node (depending on the content to prove).
*  **merkleProofPrev** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node of the previous entry (only for full proof of receipts).   
*  **txProof** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node in order to proof the transactionIndex (only needed for transaction receipts).
*  **logProof** [LogProof](#logproof) - The Log Proof in case of a `eth_getLogs`-request.   
*  **accounts** `object` - A map of addresses and their AccountProof.   
*  **txIndex** `integer` - The transactionIndex within the block (for transaactions and receipts).   
*  **signatures** `Signature[]` - Requested signatures.   


#### BlockProof

BlockProofs are used whenever you want to read data of a block and verify them. This would be:

- [eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblocktransactioncountbyhash)
- [eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblocktransactioncountbynumber)
- [eth_getBlockByHash
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblockbyhash)
- [eth_getBlockByNumber
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getblockbynumber)

The `eth_getBlockBy...` methods return the Block-Data. In this case, all we need is somebody verifying the blockhash, which is done by requiring somebody who stored a deposit and would otherwise lose it, to sign this blockhash.

The verification is then done by simply creating the blockhash and comparing this to the signed one.

The blockhash is calculated by [serializing the blockdata](https://github.com/slockit/in3/blob/master/src/util/serialize.ts#L120) with [rlp](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP) and hashing it:

```js
blockHeader = rlp.encode([
  bytes32( parentHash ),
  bytes32( sha3Uncles ),
  address( miner || coinbase ),
  bytes32( stateRoot ),
  bytes32( transactionsRoot ),
  bytes32( receiptsRoot || receiptRoot ),
  bytes256( logsBloom ),
  uint( difficulty ),
  uint( number ),
  uint( gasLimit ),
  uint( gasUsed ),
  uint( timestamp ),
  bytes( extraData ),

  ... sealFields
    ? sealFields.map( rlp.decode )
    : [
      bytes32( b.mixHash ),
      bytes8( b.nonce )
    ]
])
```

For POA-chains, the blockheader will use the `sealFields` (instead of mixHash and nonce) which are already RLP-encoded and should be added as raw data when using rlp.encode.

```js
if (keccak256(blockHeader) !== singedBlockHash) 
  throw new Error('Invalid Block')
```

In case of the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountBy...`, the proof contains the full blockHeader already serilalized plus all transactionHashes. This is needed in order to verify them in a merkle tree and compare them with the `transactionRoot`.


#### Transaction Proof

TransactionProofs are used for the following transaction-methods:

- [eth_getTransactionByHash
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionbyhash)
- [eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionbyblockhashandindex)
- [eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionbyblocknumberandindex)



```eval_rst
.. graphviz::

    digraph minimal_nonplanar_graphs {
     
    fontname="Helvetica"
      subgraph all {

        node [ fontsize = "12", style="", color=black fontname="Helvetica", shape=record ]

        subgraph block_header {
            label="blockheader" style="" color=black

            bheader[ label="parentHash|...|<tr>transactionRoot|receiptRoot|stateRoot"]
            troot:a -> bheader:tr 
        }

        subgraph cluster_client_registry {
            label="Transaction Trie"  color=lightblue  style=filled

            troot[label="|<a>0x123456|||||"]  
            ta[label="|0x123456||<a>0xabcdef|||"]  
            tb[label="|0x98765||<a>0xfcab34|||"]  
            tval[label="transaction data"]  

            ta:a -> troot:a
            tb:a -> troot:a 
            tval:a -> ta:a
        }


      }
    }

```

In order to prove the transaction data, each transaction of the containing block must be serialized

```js
transaction = rlp.encode([
  uint( tx.nonce ),
  uint( tx.gasPrice ),
  uint( tx.gas || tx.gasLimit ),
  address( tx.to ),
  uint( tx.value ),
  bytes( tx.input || tx.data ),
  uint( tx.v ),
  uint( tx.r ),
  uint( tx.s )
])
``` 

and stored in a merkle tree with `rlp.encode(transactionIndex)` as key or path, since the blockheader only contains the `transactionRoot`, which is the root-hash of the resulting merkle tree. A merkle-proof with the transactionIndex of the target transaction will then be created from this tree.


The proof-data will look like these:

```js
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 6,
  "result": {
    "blockHash": "0xf1a2fd6a36f27950c78ce559b1dc4e991d46590683cb8cb84804fa672bca395b",
    "blockNumber": "0xca",
    "from": "0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf",
    "gas": "0x55f0",
    "gasPrice": "0x0",
    "hash": "0xe9c15c3b26342e3287bb069e433de48ac3fa4ddd32a31b48e426d19d761d7e9b",
    "input": "0x00",
    "value": "0x3e8"
    ...
  },
  "in3": {
    "proof": {
      "type": "transactionProof",
      "block": "0xf901e6a040997a53895b48...", // serialized blockheader
      "merkleProof": [  /* serialized nodes starting with the root-node */
        "0xf868822080b863f86136808255f0942b5ad5c4795c026514f8317c7a215e218dc..."
        "0xcd6cf8203e8001ca0dc967310342af5042bb64c34d3b92799345401b26713b43f..."
      ],
      "txIndex": 0,
      "signatures": [...]
    }
  }
}
```


#### Receipt Proof

Proofs for the transactionReceipt are used for the following method:

- [eth_getTransactionReceipt
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionreceipt)



```eval_rst
.. graphviz::

    digraph minimal_nonplanar_graphs {
     
    fontname="Helvetica"
      subgraph all {

        node [ fontsize = "12", style="", color=black fontname="Helvetica", shape=record ]

        subgraph blockheader {
            label="blocheader" style="" color=black

            bheader[ label="parentHash|...|transactionRoot|<tr>receiptRoot|stateRoot"]
            troot:a -> bheader:tr 
        }

        subgraph cluster_client_registry {
            label="Receipt Trie"  color=lightblue  style=filled

            troot[label="|<a>0x123456|||||"]  
            ta[label="|0x123456||<a>0xabcdef|||"]  
            tb[label="|0x98765||<a>0xfcab34|||"]  
            tval[label="transaction receipt"]  

            ta:a -> troot:a
            tb:a -> troot:a 
            tval:a -> ta:a
        }


      }
    }

```

The proof works similiar to the transaction proof.

In order to create the proof we need to serialize all transaction receipts 

```js
transactionReceipt = rlp.encode([
  uint( r.status || r.root ),
  uint( r.cumulativeGasUsed ),
  bytes256( r.logsBloom ),
  r.logs.map(l => [
    address( l.address ),
    l.topics.map( bytes32 ),
    bytes( l.data )
  ])
].slice(r.status === null && r.root === null ? 1 : 0))
``` 

and store them in a merkle tree with `elp.encode(transactionIndex)` as key or path, since the blockheader only contains the `receiptRoot`, which is the root-hash of the resulting merkle tree. A merkle proof with the transactionIndex of the target transaction receipt will then be created from this tree.

Since the merkle proof is only proving the value for the given transactionIndex, we also need to prove that the transactionIndex matches the transactionHash requested. This is done by adding another MerkleProof for the transaction itself as described in the [Transaction Proof](#transaction-proof).

#### Log Proof

Proofs for logs are only for the one RPC-method:

- [eth_getLogs
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getlogs)

Since logs or events are based on the TransactionReceipts, the only way to prove them is by proving the TransactionReceipt each event belongs to.

That's why this proof needs to provide:
- all blockheaders where these events occured
- all TransactionReceipts plus their MerkleProof of the logs
- all MerkleProofs for the transactions in order to prove the transactionIndex

The proof data structure will look like this:

```ts
  Proof {
    type: 'logProof',
    logProof: {
      [blockNr: string]: {  // the blockNumber in hex as key
        block : string  // serialized blockheader
        receipts: {
          [txHash: string]: {  // the transactionHash as key
            txIndex: number // transactionIndex within the block
            txProof: string[] // the merkle Proof-Array for the transaction
            proof: string[] // the merkle Proof-Array for the receipts
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```


In order to create the proof, we group all events into their blocks and transactions, so we only need to provide the blockheader once per block. 
The merkle-proofs for receipts are created as described in the [Receipt Proof](#receipt-proof).

#### Account Proof

Proofing an account-value applies to these functions:

- [eth_getBalance](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getbalance)
- [eth_getCode](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getcode)
- [eth_getTransactionCount](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactioncount)
- [eth_getStorageAt](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getstorageat)

Each of these values are stored in the account-object:

```js
account = rlp.encode([
  uint( nonce),
  uint( balance),
  bytes32( storageHash || ethUtil.KECCAK256_RLP),
  bytes32( codeHash || ethUtil.KECCAK256_NULL)
])
```

The proof of an account is created by taking the state merkle tree and creating a MerkleProof. Since all of the above RPC-methods only provide a single value, the proof must contain all four values in order to encode them and verify the value of the MerkleProof. 

For verification, the `stateRoot` of the blockHeader is used and `keccak(accountProof.address)` as the path or key within the merkle tree.

```js
verifyMerkleProof(
 block.stateRoot, // expected merkle root
 keccak(accountProof.address), // path, which is the hashed address
 accountProof.accountProof), // array of Buffer with the merkle-proof-data
 isNotExistend(accountProof) ? null : serializeAccount(accountProof), // the expected serialized account
)
```

In case the account does not exist yet (which is the case if `none` == `startNonce` and `codeHash` == `'0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470'`), the proof may end with one of these nodes:
    
- The last node is a branch, where the child of the next step does not exist.
- The last node is a leaf with a different relative key.

Both would prove that this key does not exist.

For `eth_getStorageAt`, an additional storage proof is required. This is created by using the `storageHash` of the account and creating a MerkleProof using the hash of the storage key (`keccak(key)`) as path.


```js
verifyMerkleProof(
  bytes32( accountProof.storageHash ),   // the storageRoot of the account
  keccak(bytes32(s.key)),  // the path, which is the hash of the key
  s.proof.map(bytes), // array of Buffer with the merkle-proof-data
  s.value === '0x0' ? null : util.rlp.encode(s.value) // the expected value or none to proof non-existence
))
```


```eval_rst
.. graphviz::

    digraph minimal_nonplanar_graphs {
     
    fontname="Helvetica"
      subgraph all {

        node [ fontsize = "12", style="", color=black fontname="Helvetica", shape=record ]

        subgraph cluster_block_header {
            label="Blockheader" color=white  style=filled

            bheader[ label="parentHash|...|<tr>stateRoot|transactionRoot|receiptRoot|..."]
        }

        subgraph cluster_state_trie {
            label="State Trie"  color=lightblue  style=filled

            troot[label="|<a>0x123456|||||<b>0xabcdef"]  
            ta[label="|0x123456||<a>0xabcdef|||"]  
            tb[label="|0x98765||<a>0xfcab34|||"]  
            tval[label="nonce|balance|<sr>storageHash|codeHash"]  

            ta:a -> troot:a
            tb:a -> troot:b 
            tval:a -> ta:a
        }

        subgraph cluster_storage_trie {
            label="Storage Trie"  color=lightblue  style=filled

            sroot[label="|<a>0x123456|||||<b>0xabcdef"]  
            sa[label="|0x123456||<a>0xabcdef|||"]  
            sb[label="|0x98765||<a>0xfcab34|||"]  
            sval[label="storage value"]  

            sa:a -> sroot:a
            sb:a -> sroot:b 
            sval:a -> sa:a
        }

        sroot:a -> tval:sr
        troot:a -> bheader:tr 

      }
    }

```




#### Call Proof

Call proofs are used whenever you are calling a read-only function of a smart contract:

- [eth_call](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call)


Verifying the result of an `eth_call` is a little bit more complex because the response is a result of executing opcodes in the vm. The only way to do so is to reproduce it and execute the same code. That's why a call proof needs to provide all data used within the call. This means:

- All referred accounts including the code (if it is a contract), storageHash, nonce and balance.
- All storage keys that are used (this can be found by tracing the transaction and collecting data based on the `SLOAD`-opcode).
- All blockdata, which are referred at (besides the current one, also the `BLOCKHASH`-opcodes are referring to former blocks). 

For verifying, you need to follow these steps:

1. Serialize all used blockheaders and compare the blockhash with the signed hashes. (See [BlockProof](#blockproof))

2. Verify all used accounts and their storage as showed in [Account Proof](#account-proof).

3. Create a new [VM](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm) with a MerkleTree as state and fill in all used value in the state:


```js 
  // create new state for a vm
  const state = new Trie()
  const vm = new VM({ state })

  // fill in values
  for (const adr of Object.keys(accounts)) {
    const ac = accounts[adr]

    // create an account-object
    const account = new Account([ac.nonce, ac.balance, ac.stateRoot, ac.codeHash])

    // if we have a code, we will set the code
    if (ac.code) account.setCode( state, bytes( ac.code ))

    // set all storage-values
    for (const s of ac.storageProof)
      account.setStorage( state, bytes32( s.key ), rlp.encode( bytes32( s.value )))

    // set the account data
    state.put( address( adr ), account.serialize())
  }

  // add listener on each step to make sure it uses only values found in the proof
  vm.on('step', ev => {
     if (ev.opcode.name === 'SLOAD') {
        const contract = toHex( ev.address ) // address of the current code
        const storageKey = bytes32( ev.stack[ev.stack.length - 1] ) // last element on the stack is the key
        if (!getStorageValue(contract, storageKey))
          throw new Error(`incomplete data: missing key ${storageKey}`)
     }
     /// ... check other opcodes as well
  })

  // create a transaction
  const tx = new Transaction(txData)

  // run it
  const result = await vm.runTx({ tx, block: new Block([block, [], []]) })

  // use the return value
  return result.vm.return
```

In the future, we will be using the same approach to verify calls with ewasm.


## RPC-Methods Ethereum 

This section describes the behavior for each standard-RPC-method.


### web3_clientVersion

Returns the underlying client version.

See [web3_clientversion](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#web3_clientversion) for spec.
No proof or verification possible.


### web3_sha3

Returns Keccak-256 (not the standardized SHA3-256) of the given data.

See [web3_sha3](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#web3_sha3) for spec.
No proof returned, but the client must verify the result by hashing the request data itself.

### net_version

Returns the current network ID.

See [net_version](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#net_version) for spec.
No proof returned, but the client must verify the result by comparing it to the used chainId.

### eth_blockNumber

Returns the number of the most recent block.

See [eth_blockNumber](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_blockNumber) for spec.

### eth_getBalance

Returns the balance of the account of a given address.

See [eth_getBalance](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getBalance) for spec.
